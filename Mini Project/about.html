           Shariq Khan is a third year student in I.T.S Engineering College pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science with a passion of being an enthusiast coder and making his name in the Software and IT industry. He comes from Lucknow with a good educational background and is working hard towards his goals. In his free time, he loves to play music and sing along.
<br>The idea of this website comes from his second love, Music. He had a hard time learning to play guitar because of the less resources he had. Searching online for the videos, lessons and guidance takes a lot of your time when you are trying to learn something new. So, in this website he has organized everything required for a beginner to learn a guitar. From buying one to the required videos and YouTube links.
<br>Hope you guys will have a great time learning music.
    <br>Thank You!!
