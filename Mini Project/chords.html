    <p>Welcome to the online library of guitar chords. I’ve designed this page to start you off with some beginner guitar chords and slowly progress you to more advanced chords played in different positions on the fretboard. </p>
  </div><br>
  <div class="open-chordsh">
    <h2>Open Chords</h2><br>
    <p>The open chords are some of the more common guitar chords you learn as a beginner guitarist. They are played in the first position and involve the use of open strings (in other words, strings that you strum without pressing down on a fret). Every guitar player should know all of these chords.</p>

  <div class="major-chordsh">
    <h2>Major Chords</h2><br>
    <p>The first thing you notice is that major chords sound bright and happy. Learning all of these major chords is a good start, but you’ll also need to learn the minors if you want to play songs</p>

  <div class="minor-chordsh">
    <h2>Minor Chords</h2><br>
    <p>Sort of opposite of major chords, minor chords sound more dark and sad. You’ll find that playing a song in a major key, it still has minor chords in it. Learn all of the minor chords for every major you learned above and you will have a great foundation for becoming a proficient guitarist.</p>

  <div class="barre-chordsh">
    <h2>Barre-Chords</h2><br>
    <p>Barre chords are chords that are played with the first finger barring across several strings. Once you learn a few barre chords and get used to using your first finger in this way, it really opens up the fretboard to play chords all over the neck. Here are a few examples of barre chords below. See if you can come up with even more chords by changing the root note of the chord.</p>

  <div class="power-chordsh">
    <h2>Power Chords</h2><br>
    <p>Power chords are guitar chords played with just two notes, the root and the 5th. The 3rd is left out of power chords, and because of this the power chord has neither a major nor a minor sound. Here are a few examples, as you can see these are very simple guitar chords. Once you know one, you know them all.</p>

    <div class="C5"><img src="C5.png" alt="C5"></div>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="chord-shapesh">
    <h2>Chord Shapes</h2><br>
    <p>
      When learning these chords all over the fretboard of the guitar, you will see some hand shapes repeating. These are called chord shapes. A quick way to see this in action is when learning the barre chords mentioned above. You will see the C, A, G, E and D shapes.
      <br><br>
      A fun exercise is to use a capo and play through all of the open chord shapes. See how the capo changes the root note to form different chords out of their natural shapes. For example, if you are capo’d on the 2nd fret and you play a chord in the G shape you are actually playing an A chord.</p>
  </div>
  <br>

  <br><br>
  <div class="progressionh">
    <h2>Chord progression</h2><br>
    <p>A chord progression is nothing more than chords played in a sequence. Chord progressions are noted with roman numerals 1 through 7. Uppercase roman numerals represent the major chords, and lowercase represent the minor chords and diminished chord. There is much more to learn here in regards to music theory, but for now we can just stick to that simple explanation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="strumh">
    <h2>Strumming Pattern</h2><br>
    <p>
      If you are just starting out, try to use a down down down up down up strumming pattern. This is a simple pattern and helps you get your right hand rhythm established. Once you master this pattern you can explore other strumming patterns, and you can quickly learn new ones by mimicking the strumming you hear in songs as you learn
